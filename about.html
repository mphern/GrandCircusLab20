    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Growing up in a military family, I always knew I wanted to be a fighter pilot.
        My father, Duke Mitchell, was also a fighter pilot.  He was shot down and killed 
        during the Vietnam War when I was very young.  I've been told that my father was
        the best fight pilot in the Navy so I worked my butt over to live up to his legacy.
        I've been told my piloting style is at times "dangerous and reckless" but I always
        put my plane and crew first.  My hard work paid off when I was invited to the Top Gun 
        program, a program where the best pilots compete to be the best of the best.  Unfortunately
        during the program tragedy struck when my co-pilot, Nick "Goose" Bradshaw, was killed during
        an excercise due to a mulfunction during an ejection from the aircraft caused by an engine blowout.  
        I went into a deep depression after that and I thought I would never be able to reach my full 
        potential as a fighter pilot.

        After the conclusion of the program.  Me and my fellow Top Gun pilots were called into action 
        to provide air support for a disabled aircraft carrier that had wandered into enemy waters.
        Pilots Tom "Iceman" Kazansky and Rick "Hollywood" Neven were first in the air.  They encountered
        5 MiG-28s which engaged them and Hollywood was shot down.  I was then given clearance to take off
        and join the battle.  During the fight, my engines nearly blowout again, the same way they did when
        Goose was killed.  I was able to recover, but that ordeal brought back the terrible memories of the
        day I lost my best friend.  I looked deep down inside and asked Goose to give me strength the continue
        the battle.  Just then, I felt Goose's presence and I knew what I had to do.  I re-engaged in the battle,
        worked my magic, and soon the battle was won.  
    </p>
    <p>
        After that day, I re-evaluated my life goals and decided that I wanted to become a Top Gun instructor and teach
        a new generation of fighter pilots how to become the best of the best.
